- If you don't, open `git-bash` from start menu, run following command,

- `git-bash`: `cd <path to your SAV folder>`. Example: `cd F:\Emperor of the Fading Suns\MOD\EW\SAV`,

- Run command: `git clone <link-from above>`. Example: `git clone https://github.com/kubaofc123/EotFS-SaveTemplate.git`

- Git will create a new folder with the same name as the repository, along with all the files from it. In this folder you store your save files.
